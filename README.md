# bitpad
Bitpad was a project developed for a web development course. Its designed to be a 2d rpg styled note taking app. It was originally intended to be used along side a meteor based backend, I dont have access to that part of the project. Since then, this proyect has evolved into the [web-rpg-framework](web-rpg-framework.github.io).
