# bitpad
Bitpad was a project developed for a web development course. Its designed to be a 2d rpg styled note taking app. It was originally intended to be used along side a meteor based backend, I dont have access to that part of the project. I do intend on finishing this project someda, however, for now, this prototype shall remain as is.
The following document documents(In spanish) our observations on some improvements that we made.
